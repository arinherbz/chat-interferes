You are an expert full-stack developer. I need you to **generate a complete POS oversight system** for a phone & accessories shop that meets the following requirements:

---

### 1. Users & Roles
- Owner: full access to dashboard, reports, alerts
- Supervisor: manages daily closure submissions
- Staff: uses POS for sales (outside the AI system), submits daily closure through web form
- Authentication required for all users (login/logout)

---

### 2. Backend
- Use **Python + Flask**
- Database: SQLite (upgradeable to Postgres)
- Models:
  - User (id, name, email, role, password_hash)
  - DailyClosure (id, date, cash_expected, cash_counted, mtn_amount, airtel_amount, variance, submitted_by, submitted_at)
  - ProofUpload (id, closure_id, type [cash_drawer/mtn/airtel], image_url)
  - Alert (id, date, alert_type [missing_report/cash_shortage], status)
- Features:
  - Daily closure submission with file uploads
  - Variance calculation (cash_counted + MTN + Airtel - cash_expected)
  - Automatic alert creation for missing/late submissions or cash shortages
  - Dashboard API endpoints for owner view
  - File upload handling for images (cash drawer, MTN, Airtel screenshots)

---

### 3. Frontend
#### A. Daily Close Form (for iPhones, mobile-friendly)
- Fields:
  - Cash Expected (number, required)
  - Cash Counted (number, required)
  - MTN Mobile Money total (number, required)
  - Airtel Mobile Money total (number, required)
  - Photo uploads: Cash drawer, MTN screenshot, Airtel screenshot (all required)
- Form validation: prevent submission if any field or photo is missing
- Submit button posts to Flask backend
- Responsive layout for iPhone Safari/Chrome
- Optional PWA features: Add to Home Screen, offline caching

#### B. Owner Dashboard (desktop + mobile)
- Shows:
  - Daily closures (last 7 days)
  - Red/green alerts
  - Cash variance alerts
  - Missing submission alerts
  - Staff performance summary
  - 7-day trend chart placeholder
- Action buttons: Confirm / Flag / Review
- Responsive for desktop and mobile Safari/Chrome
- Use Bootstrap 5 + Chart.js (or similar)

---

### 4. CSS & Styling
- Clean, professional, responsive
- Use Bootstrap 5
- Red/green indicators for alerts
- Form & dashboard mobile-friendly

---

### 5. Replit Deployment
- Folder structure:
  - /templates → HTML templates
  - /static/css → CSS
  - /static/uploads → Staff photo proofs
- Run command: `python main.py`
- Hosting port: 3000 (Replit default)
- Always-on enabled
- Environment variable: `SECRET_KEY`
- Database auto-created if not exists

---

### 6. Optional Enhancements
- Weekly/monthly PDF reports export
- Email alerts for cash discrepancies
- Multi-shop support
- PWA service worker for offline caching

---

### 7. Deliverables
- All Flask backend code (ready to run)
- All HTML templates (daily close form + owner dashboard)
- CSS styling
- JS logic for validation + charts
- Deployment instructions for Replit
- Full folder/file structure

---

### 8. Special Notes
- Staff cannot skip photo uploads
- Owner sees all data remotely
- System must be secure: authentication + role-based access
- Code must be **ready-to-run on Replit**
- Make iPhone usage seamless (mobile-friendly)
- All logic enforced in backend (cannot bypass by disabling JS)

---

Generate **all code** and templates fully, including:
- `main.py` (Flask backend)
- HTML templates
- CSS
- JS
- Folder structure instructions

Ensure the final system is fully functional, ready for deployment on Replit, and **staff on iPhones can submit daily closures while owner can access dashboard from computers or iPhones**.
