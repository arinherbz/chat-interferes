Running tests
=============

From the project root run:

```bash
# install dependencies (only needed once or when package.json changes)
npm install

# run the test suite
npm test
```

Or use the helper script:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

If you run into failures, paste the test output here and I will help debug.
