# Deploy 24/7 - Cheapest Always-On Options

## Option 1: DigitalOcean App Platform ($6/month) ⭐ EASIEST

### 1-Click Deploy (3 minutes)

1. **Create account** at [digitalocean.com](https://digitalocean.com)
2. Click **"Apps"** in sidebar
3. Click **"Create App"**
4. Select **GitHub** → Choose `arinherbz/chat-interferes`
5. Confirm settings (auto-detected)
6. Click **"Next"** → **"Create Resources"**
7. Wait 5 min → Your app is live 24/7 ✅

**That's it!** You get a public URL like: `https://techpos-abc123.ondigitalocean.app`

## Option 2: Render (Low-cost managed hosting)

For Ariostore, Render is the platform already matched by the repo automation:

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Create a new Web Service from GitHub
3. Select this repo
4. Use `render.yaml`
5. Set `DEPLOY_HEALTHCHECK_URL` to `/health`
6. Let GitHub Actions trigger deploys using the Render deploy hook

Cost: free tier available, paid tiers recommended for lower cold-start latency

## Option 3: Run on Your Machine (Free but complicated)

Use **ngrok** to expose your local machine to internet:

```bash
# Install ngrok
brew install ngrok

# In one terminal, run your app
npm run dev

# In another terminal, expose it
ngrok http 5000

# You get a public URL like: https://abc123.ngrok.io
```

**Pros**: Free  
**Cons**: Only works if your machine is on 24/7, slower, less reliable
